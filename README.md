# DPHXUnpackAndLoad
This tool's purpose is to help its users download, unpack, visualize and load MSFS soaring tasks that have been shared using the Discord Post Helper tool (https://github.com/siglr/DiscordPostHelper).

It is a Windows forms application based on the Microsoft .NET Framework and as such, requires version 4.8 or later of that framework. You can download the .NET Framework here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer.

To download the latest release, click here: https://github.com/siglr/DPHXUnpackAndLoad/releases/latest

To install for the first time, simply create a folder anywhere on your computer and extract the files in that folder. After first installation, the application supports auto-update so shouldn't be a problem anymore.

You should launch the tool at least once to adjust the settings and various folders. Double-check the MSFS folders that have been detected just in case they're wrong.

To associate .DPHX files to this application, simply double-click on one and Windows will ask you which program you want to use. Or, right-click on a file and select "Open with..." which should do the same. Then navigate to where you extracted the files and select the executable, then make sure to select "Always" so every .DPHX files you double-click next will automatically open in the tool.

For support and more information about the tool, you can visit this Discord Server. There you will also find links to tutorial videos explaining how to use it.
