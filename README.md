# DPHXUnpackAndLoad
This tool's purpose is to help its users download, unpack, visualize and load MSFS soaring tasks that have been published on [WeSimGlide.org](https://wesimglide.org) using the [Discord Post Helper tool](https://github.com/siglr/DiscordPostHelper).

It consists of two applications. The main one being a Windows Forms application and the second one a small listening app that runs in the background in your system tray. Both are based on the Microsoft .NET Framework and as such, requires version 4.8 or later of that framework. You can download the .NET Framework here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer.

To install for the first time, simply create a folder anywhere on your computer and extract the files in that folder. After first installation, the application supports auto-update so shouldn't be a problem anymore.

You should launch the tool at least once to adjust the settings and various folders. Double-check the MSFS folders that have been detected just in case they're wrong.

To associate .DPHX files to this application, simply double-click on one and Windows will ask you which program you want to use. Or, right-click on a file and select "Open with..." which should do the same. Then navigate to where you extracted the files and select the executable file "DPHX Unpack and Load.exe", then make sure to select "Always" so every .DPHX files you double-click next will automatically open in the tool.

*Note: While some users report that Windows Defender is detecting threats from the main executable in this tool, they seem to be false positive as running analysis with BitDefender or Kasperky online returns zero threat at all. I've submitted the file to Microsoft Security Intelligence for an in-depth analysis and will report back with the final result, but the file right now shows "no malware detected".
You may need to exclude the folder where you extracted the files from your anti-virus software.*
